# Healthcare Insurance ETL & Data Visualization Project

## Overview

This project is my first individually assigned bootcamp project, where I perform an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow** and create basic data visualizations using Python and associated libraries such as pandas for creating codes, markdown for comments and matplotlib, seaborn for basic visualisations and plotly was used to create a basic visualisation that is interactive. The dataset used is a CSV file containing healthcare insurance data.

## Objectives

- **Extract** data from a CSV file
- **Transform** the data using cleaning and preprocessing techniques
- **Load** the data into a pandas DataFrame for analysis
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- Create visualizations using **matplotlib**, **seaborn** and **plotly**

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.12.8
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub
- vs code

## Key Findings
- Smokers are charged significantly higher
- BMI and age positively correlate with increased insurance charges
- Regional geographic differences are evident in pricing but not as significant as other personal features such as age, smoking habits and BMI.


## Project Structure

3. Open `Healthcare_insurance.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook in VS Code IDE.
4. Run the notebook cells to follow the ETL workflow and view the visualizations.

## Key Steps

1. **Extract:** Load the CSV data using pandas.
2. **Transform:** Clean missing values, check data types, and preprocess as needed.
3. **Load:** Store the cleaned data in a DataFrame.
4. **Visualize:** Generate plots to explore relationships and trends in the data.

## Example Visualizations

- Distribution of insurance charges
- Correlation heatmaps
- Age vs. charges scatter plots
- Categorical comparisons (e.g., smoker vs. non-smoker)
## Credits
- Coopilot for code correction and explanation
- Chatgpt for code research and context
